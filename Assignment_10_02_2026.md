## Charge

An electric charge is defined as a physical state of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract. The formula is defined as $Q = I * t$, where Q is charge, I is current and t is time. The unit of Charge is Ampere hour ($Ah$).

## Current

Current is the rate at which charged particles flow when moving through an electric conductor or space. It's formula is $I = Q/t$. It's unit is Ampere ($A$).

## Potential difference

Potential difference, or Voltage, is the difference in electric potential energy per unit charge between two points in a circuit. The formula is $V = W/Q$, where V is the potential difference in volts, W is work down in Joules and Q is charge in Coloumbs. The SI unit of Voltage is Joule per Coloumb, which is equal to Volt ($V$).

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. The formula is defined as $V = IR$, where I is the current through the conductor, R is the resistance, and V is the voltage measured across the conductor.

## Resistance

Resistance is the measure of opposition to the flow of current in an electrical circuit. It is measured in ohms ($\mathsf{\Omega}$). Derived from Ohm's law, the formula for Resistance is $R = V/I$.

## Resistors

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electronic component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit component. In a circuit, these are used to reduct current flow.

## Resistors colour coding

Colour coding in resistors are a standard that specifies the properties of resistors for use in equipment. The standard that color coding is the EIA RS-279.

The color band system in resistors generally 4 bands, though sometimes there can be 5 bands. The first and second band denotes their respectice significant number. The third band is the decimal multiplier and the 4th band is the tolerance of value in percentage.

## Resistors in Series and Parallel

### Series

Resistors in series are connected end-to-end, making the same current flow through each resistor consecutively. The formula, therefore, looks like:
$R_{total} = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}...$
If one of the resistors fail, the entire circuit fails.

### Parallel

Resistors in parallel are connected across the same two points, therefore sharing the same voltage, with a lower total resistance. This is calculated as:
$1/R_{total} = 1/R_{1} + 1/R_{2} + 1/R_{3}...$
If one of the resistors fail, the circuit will still work.

## KCL

Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the algebraic sum of all currents entering and exiting a node must equal zero. Since electric charge is conserved, charge cannot accumulate in a node. The formula is simple:
$\Sigma I =0$
or
$\Sigma I_{in} = \Sigma I_{out}$

## KVL

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop is zero.
$\Sigma V = 0$
